This is my first Elm app, you can try it [here](http://austinlyons.github.io/memory-verses/). I started with [elm-webpack-starter](https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter).

There are really only two files with Elm code, [Main.elm](https://github.com/austinlyons/memory-verses/blob/master/src/Main.elm) and [Verses.elm](https://github.com/austinlyons/memory-verses/blob/master/src/Verses.elm)

Caution: I have no idea what I'm doing.
